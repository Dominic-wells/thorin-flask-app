<h2>About Page</h2>
<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
  <p>
    In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain.
    Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
    2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the
    Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some
    point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained
    the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
  <p>
    Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of
    Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
    the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

    <h3>Óin</h3>
    <p>Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of The Company of Thorin.</p>

    <h3>Glóin</h3>
  <p>Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger brother of Óin.

    In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.
    
    In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".</p>

    <h3>Balin</h3>
    <p>Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.</p>

    <h3>Gandalf</h3>
    <p>Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur[1], and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä.[2] In his "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like Varda[3], yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he followed the example of Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drawing those who listened to him out of despair.</p>
